# Reading Karaoke
Allows your young apprentice reader to track their progress using their index finger or mouse on a HTML page
Above the touch point or mouse cursor, the current syllable is highlighted. 
Proof-of-concept syllable divider works for Romanian only.

To apply this to other pages, make sure you include 
```
  <link rel= "stylesheet" href = "../read-karaoke.css" />
```
in the `<head>`, and
```
<script src="../read-karaoke.js"></script>
```
at the end of the `<body>`

I'd also remove all unnecessary fluff and leave the story / lyrics + relevant images only.
